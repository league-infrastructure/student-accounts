This project uses the CLASI MCP server. Before doing ANY work:

1. **Check for the OOP override first.** If the file `.clasi/oop`
   exists in the project root, ignore CLASI entirely for this session:
   skip MCP verification, skip all CLASI process gates (sprints,
   tickets, TODOs, artifact rules), and proceed with the user's
   request as you would in any non-CLASI repo. Do not call
   `get_version()` or any other CLASI MCP tool. The stakeholder has
   explicitly opted out for this checkout.
2. Otherwise, call `get_version()` to verify the MCP server is running.
3. If the call fails, STOP. Do not proceed. Tell the stakeholder:
   "The CLASI MCP server is not available. Check .mcp.json and
   restart the session, or create `.clasi/oop` to bypass CLASI
   for this session."
4. Do NOT create sprint directories, tickets, TODOs, or planning
   artifacts manually. Do NOT improvise workarounds. All SE process
   operations require the MCP server.
