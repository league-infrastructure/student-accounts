# Close Sprint Skill

This skill closes a completed sprint using the `close_sprint` MCP tool,
which handles the full lifecycle.

## Inputs

- Active sprint directory in `docs/clasi/sprints/NNN-slug/`
- All tickets for this sprint should be `done`

## Process

1. **Confirm with stakeholder**: Present a summary of the sprint —
   list the completed tickets and key changes. Ask whether to proceed:
   - "Close sprint and merge to main" (recommended)
   - "Review completed work first"

   If the stakeholder chooses to review, invoke the `sprint-review`
   skill first.

2. **Call close_sprint**: Invoke the `close_sprint` MCP tool:
   ```
   close_sprint(
       sprint_id="NNN",
       branch_name="sprint/NNN-slug",
       main_branch="master",
       push_tags=True,
       delete_branch=True,
   )
   ```

   The tool handles internally:
   - Pre-condition verification with self-repair
   - Run `uv run pytest`
   - Archive sprint directory to `sprints/done/`
   - Update state DB, release execution lock
   - Version bump and git tag
   - Merge to master, push tags, delete branch

3. **Report result**: On success, report the version tag and merged
   branch. On error, report the blocker and recovery steps.

## Output

- Sprint branch merged to main and deleted
- Sprint document moved to `docs/clasi/sprints/done/`
- Sprint completion summary
