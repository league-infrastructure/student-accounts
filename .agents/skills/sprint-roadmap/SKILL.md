# Sprint Roadmap Skill

Group assessed TODOs into a sprint roadmap — a sequence of lightweight
sprint plans that organize the work into manageable, ordered chunks.

## When to Use

After TODOs have been created and the stakeholder wants to organize
them into sprints.

## Inputs

- `.clasi/design/overview.md` (must exist)
- Current architecture (if available)
- Issue files in `.clasi/issues/`

## Process

1. **Read issues**: Scan `.clasi/issues/` for pending issue files.
   Read each to understand the work requested.

2. **Group into sprints** based on:
   - **Related functionality** — TODOs that touch the same feature
     belong together
   - **Dependency ordering** — TODOs that depend on others must come
     in later sprints
   - **Incremental value delivery** — Each sprint should deliver usable
     progress
   - **Difficulty balancing** — Mix complex and straightforward work

3. **Create sprint directories**: For each sprint, call `create_sprint(title)`.
   The tool creates the sprint directory and writes a `sprint.md` template
   with `status: roadmap`. No other files are created at this stage.
   Edit the generated `sprint.md` to fill in:
   - Sprint goals (what the sprint accomplishes)
   - TODO references (which TODOs are addressed)
   - Rationale for grouping
   - Dependency notes

4. **Update TODOs**: For each TODO claimed by a sprint, set
   `sprint: "NNN"` in the TODO's frontmatter.

## Output

Sprint directories with lightweight `sprint.md` files, ready for
detail planning via the `plan-sprint` skill.
